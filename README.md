# 🤝 Mutually – Mobile Task Marketplace App (Beta)

Mutually is a cross-platform app for peer-to-peer task requests. It has real-time chat, geolocation-based discovery, push notifications, and Stripe-powered payments.

I built it solo, after hours, while working as a full-time intern at AMD. Learned mobile dev from scratch, shipped a working beta, and got it live on TestFlight.
